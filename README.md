# Wordle GUI Game

Our Java-based Wordle game, developed in NetBeans 14 and compatible with Java 11, recreates the popular word-guessing experience in an interactive GUI. Players have six chances to guess the hidden word, with hints provided for each guess. This project supports saving and reviewing game history, making it easy to track past games and scores.
